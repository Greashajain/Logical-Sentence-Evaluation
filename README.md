# Logical-Sentence-Evaluation-
This project provides a structure for constructing and evaluating logical sentences. It uses Python classes to represent different logical constructs like symbols, negation, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications, and biconditionals. These classes allow us to create complex logical sentences and evaluate their truth values based on a given model.
